.SH NAME
weston.ini \- configuration file for
.B Weston
\- the reference Wayland
compositor
.SH INTRODUCTION
.B Weston
obtains configuration from its command line parameters and the configuration
file described here.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Weston
uses a configuration file called
.I weston.ini
for its setup.
The
.I weston.ini
configuration file is searched for in one of the following places when the
server is started:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.BR "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/weston.ini   " "(if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)"
.BR "$HOME/.config/weston.ini      " "(if $HOME is set)"
.B  "weston/weston.ini in each"
.BR "\ \ \ \ $XDG_CONFIG_DIR           " "(if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is set)"
.BR "/etc/xdg/weston/weston.ini    " "(if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is not set)"
.BR "<current dir>/weston.ini      " "(if no variables were set)"
.fi
.RE
.PP
where environment variable
.B $HOME
is the user's home directory, and
.B $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
is the user specific configuration directory, and
.B $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
is a colon
.B ':'
delimited listed of configuration base directories, such as
.BR /etc/xdg-foo:/etc/xdg .
.PP
The
.I weston.ini
file is composed of a number of sections which may be present in any order, or
omitted to use default configuration values. Each section has the form:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.BI [ SectionHeader ]
.RI Key1=Value1
.RI Key2=Value2
    ...
.fi
.RE
.PP
The spaces are significant.
Comment lines are ignored:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.IR "#comment"
.fi
.RE
.PP
The section headers are:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.BR "core           " "The core modules"
.BR "shell          " "Desktop customization"

Possible value types are string, signed and unsigned 32-bit
integer, and boolean. Strings must not be quoted, do not support any
escape sequences, and run till the end of the line. Integers can
be given in decimal (e.g. 123), octal (e.g. 0173), and hexadecimal
(e.g. 0x7b) form. Boolean values can be only 'true' or 'false'.
.RE
.SH "CORE SECTION"
The
.B core
section is used to select the startup compositor modules.
.TP 7
.BI "modules=" desktop-shell.so,xwayland.so
specifies the modules to load (string). Available modules in the
.IR "__weston_modules_dir__"
directory are:
.PP
.RS 10
.nf
.BR desktop-shell.so
.BR tablet-shell.so
.BR xwayland.so
.fi
.RE
.TP 7
.TP 7
.BI "backend=" headless-backend.so
overrides defaults backend. Available backend modules in the
.IR "__weston_modules_dir__"
directory are:
.PP
.RS 10
.nf
.BR drm-backend.so
.BR fbdev-backend.so
.BR headless-backend.so
.BR rdp-backend.so
.BR rpi-backend.so

.fi
.RE
.BI "gbm-format="format
sets the GBM format used for the framebuffer for the GBM backend. Can be
.B xrgb8888,
.B xrgb2101010,
.B rgb565.

.RS
.PP

.SH "SHELL SECTION"
The
.B shell
section is used to customize the compositor. Some keys may not be handled by
different shell plugins.
.PP
The entries that can appear in this section are:
.TP 7
.BI "client=" file
sets the path for the shell client to run. If not specified
.I __weston_shell_client__
is launched (string).
.TP 7
.BI "background-image=" file
sets the path for the background image file (string).
.TP 7
.BI "background-type=" tile
determines how the background image is drawn (string). Can be
.BR scale ", " scale-crop " or " tile " (default)."
Scale means scaled to fit the output precisely, not preserving aspect ratio.
Scale-crop preserves aspect ratio, scales the background image just big
enough to cover the output, and centers it. The image ends up cropped from
left and right, or top and bottom, if the aspect ratio does not match the
output. Tile repeats the background image to fill the output.
.TP 7
.BI "background-color=" 0xAARRGGBB
sets the color of the background (unsigned integer). The hexadecimal
digit pairs are in order alpha, red, green, and blue.
.TP 7
.BI "panel-color=" 0xAARRGGBB
sets the color of the panel (unsigned integer). The hexadecimal
digit pairs are in order transparency, red, green, and blue. Examples:
.PP
.RS 10
.nf
.BR "0xffff0000    " "Red"
.BR "0xff00ff00    " "Green"
.BR "0xff0000ff    " "Blue"
.BR "0x00ffffff    " "Fully transparent"

surfaces, resizing, rotating, switching, closing and setting the transparency
for windows, controlling the backlight and zooming the desktop. Possible values:
ctrl, alt, super (default)
.TP 7
.BI "num-workspaces=" 6
defines the number of workspaces (unsigned integer). The user can switch

.TP 7
.BI "cursor-size=" 24

.SH "SCREENSAVER SECTION"
The
.B screensaver
section is used to select and schedule a screensaver.
The
.B screensaver
section is optional, as are all of the entries that may be specified in
it.
.TP 7
.BI "path=" /usr/libexec/weston-screensaver
This instructs the compositor to use the selected screensaver client on a given
path (string). If this line is missing or commented out, the screensaver in
.B "weston(1)"
is disabled.
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "duration=" 600
The idle time in seconds until the screensaver disappears in order to save power
(unsigned integer).
.SH "OUTPUT SECTION"
There can be multiple output sections, each corresponding to one output. It is
currently only recognized by the drm and x11 backends.
.TP 7
.BI "name=" name
sets a name for the output (string). The backend uses the name to
identify the output. All X11 output names start with a letter X.  All
Wayland output names start with the letters WL.  The available
output names for DRM backend are listed in the
.B "weston-launch(1)"
output.
Examples of usage:
.PP
.RS 10
.nf
.BR "LVDS1    " "DRM backend, Laptop internal panel no.1"
.BR "VGA1     " "DRM backend, VGA connector no.1"
.BR "X1       " "X11 backend, X window no.1"

.fi
.RE
.RS
.PP
See
.B "weston-drm(7)"
for more details.
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "mode=" mode
sets the output mode (string). The mode parameter is handled differently
depending on the backend. On the X11 backend, it just sets the WIDTHxHEIGHT of
the weston window.
The DRM backend accepts different modes:
.PP
.RS 10
.nf
.BR "WIDTHxHEIGHT    " "Resolution size width and height in pixels"
.BR "preferred       " "Uses the preferred mode"
.BR "current         " "Uses the current crt controller mode"
.BR "off             " "Disables the output"
.fi
.RE
.RS
.PP
Optionally, an user may specify a modeline, such as:
.PP
.nf
.in +4n
.nf
173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
.fi
.in
.PP
It consists of the refresh rate in Hz, horizontal and vertical resolution,
options for horizontal and vertical synchronisation. The program
.B "cvt(1)"
can provide suitable modeline string.
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "transform=" normal
The transformation applied to screen output (string). The transform key can
be one of the following 8 strings:
.PP
.RS 10
.nf
.BR  "normal        " "Normal output."
.BR  "90            " "90 degrees clockwise."
.BR  "180           " "Upside down."
.BR  "270           " "90 degrees counter clockwise."
.BR  "flipped       " "Horizontally flipped"
.BR  "flipped-90    " "Flipped and 90 degrees clockwise"
.BR  "flipped-180   " "Flipped upside down"
.BR  "flipped-270   " "Flipped and 90 degrees counter clockwise"
.fi
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "seat=" name
The logical seat name that that this output should be associated with. If this
is set then the seat's input will be confined to the output that has the seat
set on it. The expectation is that this functionality will be used in a
multiheaded environment with a single compositor for multiple output and input
configurations. The default seat is called "default" and will always be
present. This seat can be constrained like any other.
