/*
 * Ideally, the X Window Manager (XWM) and Weston Wayland compositor shouldn't
 * be in the same process because they are using two different protocol
 * streams in which one does not interface with the other. Probably the
 * biggest problem with such architecture are the potentials dead locks that
 * it may occur. So hypothetically, an X client might issue an X11 blocking
 * request via X (DRI2Authenticate) which in turn sends a Wayland blocking
 * request for Weston process it. X is blocked. At the same time, XWM might be
 * trying to process an XChangeProperty, so it requests a blocking X11 call to
 * the X server (xcb_get_property_reply -> xcb_wait_for_reply) which therefore
 * will blocks there. It's a deadlock situation and this test is trying to
 * catch that.
